# Bad Apple in ASCII

Yet another implementation of bad apple in ASCII. Mainly did it for learning myself. The scripts in this repo can be used to create your own version and serve it over web.

To use it: 

```
curl https://bad-apple.theindiandev.in
```

[Demo Video here!](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/82oxn7lwycw)


I have not included the generated frames from ffmpeg due to large repo size, you can always generate using the fish scripts in the repo. Generating the frames requires jp2a and ffmpeg, running the server requires python and flask.
